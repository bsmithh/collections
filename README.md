# collections
A short program to demonstrate the concept of collections

Although this program was originally written to demonstate basic collections, I believe it also demonstrates other fundamental concepts such as if/then statements, arrays, and loops. This program can report the number of days for any month, during a common year. It was also developed using Test Driven Development (TDD) and Jasmine!!
